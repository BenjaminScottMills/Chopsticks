# Chopsticks

This is an implementation of the children's game chopsticks (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game)) where you play against an algorithm designed to play optimally.

This uses the additional rules of the cutoff and suicide variations (see the wikipedia page), since that's how the game was played when I was a kid.
